					These are the worst days.<br>
                    <br>
					I carry guilt with me on basements. I ghost intersections, buses, empty buildings, love hotels, and screens. I receive signals transmitted from nameless bodies that swirl unanswered in the air, like smoke before the harsh golden street lights and neon signs, and I tear up from the cold as I count out loud the time passing and getting lost. So many wasted hours. so many days going out like candles one behind the other we every breath we take.<br>
                    <br>
					But we're not here to mourn the wasted time away. There are enough things to worry about already.<br>
                    <br>
					Nobody cares, I tell you. I feel it. You could livestreams slicing your veins in front of the busiest street close to you, but the car horns of the beasts would still remind you that tomorrow is Tuesday. They don't know you. The can't recognize you in traffic. They don't see what you keep, just like them, in your chest. People are islands detached from the continent of reality, and the habits they nurtured are far too firm to break.<br>
                    <br>
					That's why my hands are running through what's left of something familiar. Some kind of monument of a world sinking in real time. Small movements, small caresses, like bandages on the wounds left on us by this plane of existence. Like second hand affection on bodies made of cold marble, drowned in the concrete waves. We hug each other naked till the morning trynna float the night away. And tomorrow? We'll see what happens when tomorrow comes. There are no guarantees anymore, other than none of us seem to know how to swim.<br>
                    <br>
					I know I'm not making sense yet, but now is not the time for explanations. Just keep in mind that we're able now, I swear, to become the worst that we used to hide from the world. Matching our day and age for once, without anxiety eating us from the inside. So laugh as hard as you can before the loop, and dance around it as if no one's watching.<br>
                    <br>
                    Or as a guy used to say:<br>
                    <br>
					"I create a universe for myself and, like some fantastic tyrannical God, people it with beings who will never live for anyone else".<br>
                    <br>
                    It's me, Sweet Tyrant.<br>
