					It was around three months after I've been fired. I didn't dare to talk about it much, but it wouldn't that much of a mystery for someone to figure out why the short chick with the plaited hair isn't on the cash register giving wrong change to the old ladies anymore. To be perfectly honest, I was pretty devastated that I managed to fail even at working at the supermarket, where all you needed to get a grip was knowing how to count, wearing an “Olga” tag like a war medal, and acting like everything's okay at all times. Maybe that's why I ended up sneaking into it like a thief that day, out of stubbornness. It was the last sense of routine I had while everything was going under outside the window.<br>
					<br>
					I could barely get out the bed before four in the afternoon. And when I did, all I had planned was dragging my body before the tv to catch some telemarketing and dumb commercials until the sun was out again and I successfully forgot who I am and what I'm going through. Because what other choices did I have really? For the last two years I was jumping from one dead end job to the next, either until I get fired or until I quit. I was leaving on benefits and a sad amount of savings, and I was starting to accept the fact that this would be my life from now on. Like, what else did I really have to rely on? Studies? Big deal, the world wouldn't end with just one english teacher less. Friends? Don't get me started. Family? All I was left with was a mother with a mission to make me feel horrible every time we spoke on the phone because I wasn't bothering to go see her. But even if I did, what would I have to say to her? I was mentally collapsing. So I said “leave it for now” and kept the thought pushed back for later. That's the reason why on that particular day I didn't pick up whenever my mom was ringing this cherry ericsson I had at the time. It wasn't like I really needed to answer, I already knew everything by heart.<br>
					<br>
					“Have you seen how this girl you used to hang out at school does lately, Olga?”.<br>
					<br>
					No, mom, I haven't. It's been like ten years since I finished school.<br>
					<br>
					“She's studying this thing you used to like, she got settled, she even has her own house”.<br>
					<br>
					Well done for her I guess, and?<br>
					<br>
					“And you?”.<br>
					<br>
					I don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life anymore, mom.<br>
					<br>
					“But don't you ever think about your future?”.<br>
					<br>
					My long awaited future, huh? What a glorious future that was. It was so good, half of the people I used to know didn't make it halfway through.
